Chaos Management Agency (CMA) Digital Ecosystem

1. Project Overview: Mission Control

CMA is a cyberpunk-inspired creator management and digital media optimization agency. This digital ecosystem is designed to evolve from a static marketing presence (v1) into a full, AI-powered platform centered around the Nova Assistant (v4).

The core aesthetic is high-tech, clean but dramatic, with a dark UI and glowing cyan highlights.
