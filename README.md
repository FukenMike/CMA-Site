# Chaos Management Agency (CMA)

Chaos Management Agency is a solo digital infrastructure and operations support company that helps small organizations and nonprofit programs simplify technology, reduce recurring costs, and operate on stable, low-maintenance systems.

## What CMA Does

- Website rebuilds and migrations to modern, low-maintenance infrastructure
- Technology cost reduction and tool consolidation
- Digital infrastructure setup for domains, DNS, forms, intake, and documentation
- Nonprofit website foundations with trust-oriented structure

## What CMA Does Not Do

- Marketing campaigns or campaign management
- Public channel management or audience engagement programs
- Open-ended IT retainers by default
- Legal, financial, or clinical services

## Engagement Model

Most work is delivered as fixed-scope builds and cleanups with defined deliverables, transparent timelines, and clear documentation for handoff.

## Technology Approach (High-Level)

CMA recommends platform-agnostic, static-first solutions that limit moving parts, prioritize resilience, and minimize ongoing maintenance without locking clients into specific vendors.

## Local Preview

Open index.html in a browser, or launch a simple local server such as `python -m http.server 8000` or `npx http-server` and visit http://localhost:8000.

## Deployment

- Netlify: Drag-and-drop deployment or connect the repository with default static site settings.
- Cloudflare Pages: Connect the repository and deploy without a build command; configure custom domains as needed.

## Status

CMA is an active, evolving project; case studies will be published as projects conclude.
