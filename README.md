# Chaos Management Agency (CMA)

**Digital infrastructure and operations support for nonprofits and small organizations.**

---

## Overview

Chaos Management Agency (CMA) is a solo digital infrastructure and operations support practice.

CMA helps small nonprofits and community programs reduce technology costs, simplify fragmented tools, and operate on stable, durable web foundations. The emphasis is on clarity, resilience, and clean handoff — not ongoing dependency.

---

## What CMA Does

CMA delivers fixed-scope infrastructure builds and cleanups focused on tangible, operational outcomes:

- Website rebuilds and migrations to stable, low-maintenance infrastructure  
- Technology cost reduction through targeted tool and subscription audits  
- Digital infrastructure setup covering domains, DNS, forms, intake routing, and documentation  
- Nonprofit website foundations designed around trust, transparency, and clarity  

All work prioritizes simplicity, portability, and minimal ongoing maintenance.

## What CMA Does Not Do

To maintain clear scope and delivery quality, CMA does not provide:

- Marketing campaigns or growth programs  
- Public channel management or audience engagement services  
- Open-ended IT retainers by default  
- Custom application development  
- Legal, financial, or clinical services  

---

## Engagement Model

Engagements are structured as fixed-scope builds or cleanups with clearly defined deliverables.

Documentation and handoff are included so organizations can operate independently without reliance on ongoing retainer relationships.

---

## Technology Approach (High-Level)

CMA applies a **complexity-appropriate, platform-agnostic approach** centered on performance, resilience, and long-term maintainability.

Static-first solutions are used where they provide the greatest reliability and cost efficiency. More dynamic architectures are employed only when organizational requirements justify them. Tools and platforms are selected collaboratively during scoping to meet real needs without introducing unnecessary complexity or proprietary lock-in.
