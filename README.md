# Chaos Management Agency (CMA)

Digital infrastructure and operations support for nonprofits and small organizations.

---

## Overview

Chaos Management Agency (CMA) is a solo digital infrastructure and operations support practice. CMA helps small nonprofits and community programs reduce technology costs, simplify fragmented tools, and operate on stable web foundations. The focus is on clarity, durability, and clean handoff — not ongoing dependency.

---

## What CMA Does

CMA provides fixed-scope infrastructure builds and cleanups focused on tangible outcomes:

- Website rebuilds and migrations to stable, low-maintenance infrastructure
- Technology cost reduction through tool and subscription audits
- Digital infrastructure setup covering domains, DNS, forms, intake routing, and documentation
- Nonprofit website foundations designed around trust, transparency, and clarity

All work emphasizes simplicity, portability, and minimal ongoing maintenance.

---

## What CMA Does Not Do

To maintain clear scope, CMA does not provide:

- Marketing campaigns or growth programs
- Public channel management or audience engagement services
- Open-ended IT retainers by default
- Custom application development
- Legal, financial, or clinical services

---

## Engagement Model

Most engagements are structured as fixed-scope builds or cleanups with clearly defined deliverables. Documentation and handoff are included so organizations can operate independently without ongoing retainer commitments.

---

## Technology Approach (High-Level)

CMA applies a static-first, platform-agnostic approach centered on performance, resilience, and durability. Specific tools are selected collaboratively during scoping to match organizational needs without locking clients into proprietary ecosystems.

## Deployment

- Netlify: Deploy by uploading the directory or connecting the repository with default static site settings.
- Cloudflare Pages: Deploy by connecting the repository without a build command and configuring domains as needed.

## Status

CMA is an active, evolving project. Case studies will be published as current projects conclude.
