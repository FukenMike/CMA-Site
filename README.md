# Chaos Management Agency (CMA)

Digital infrastructure and operations support for nonprofits and small organizations.

---

## Overview

Chaos Management Agency (CMA) is a solo digital infrastructure and operations support practice. CMA helps small nonprofits and community programs reduce technology costs, simplify fragmented tools, and operate on stable, low-maintenance web foundations. The focus is on clarity, durability, and clean handoff — not ongoing dependency.

---

## What CMA Does

CMA provides fixed-scope infrastructure builds and cleanups focused on tangible outcomes:

- Website rebuilds and migrations to modern, low-maintenance infrastructure
- Technology cost reduction through tool and subscription audits
- Digital infrastructure setup covering domains, DNS, forms, intake routing, and documentation
- Nonprofit website foundations designed around trust, transparency, and clarity

All work emphasizes simplicity, portability, and reduced long-term maintenance.

---

## What CMA Does Not Do

To maintain quality and scope control, CMA does not provide:

- Marketing campaigns or growth programs
- Public channel management or audience engagement services
- Open-ended IT retainers by default
- Custom application development
- Legal, financial, or clinical services

---

## Engagement Model

Most engagements are structured as fixed-scope builds or cleanups with clearly defined deliverables. Documentation and handoff are included so organizations can operate independently without ongoing retainer commitments.

---

## Technology Approach (High-Level)

CMA applies a static-first, platform-agnostic approach centered on performance, resilience, and long-term maintainability. Specific tools are selected collaboratively during scoping to match organizational needs without locking clients into proprietary ecosystems.
